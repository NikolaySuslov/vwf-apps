# The selection_table represents an activity in the marbles application.
# Activities are any interactable activity in the marbles gamespace. They generally are directly 
# interfaced with by the user model.  While a user is 'attached' to an activity, the various
# user input from its view is directed via the correlated user node to the activity, so as to
# keep track of which user is responsible for what action.
# The selection table activity is a table with example marbles laid out on it, which the user can
# select for use certain marbles games.

methods:
#The first four methods are default methods all activities should implement, and handle when
#the user forwards the appropriate event to the activity model for handling.
#The parameters are nodeId, and eventParameters (which are passed through from the normal
# keyDown/keyUp/pointerDown/pointerUp events) followed by a user parameter (the actual user
# object for the user that the event originated from).
  handleKeyDown:
  handleKeyUp:
  handlePointerDown:
  handlePointerUp:
# The activitySelected method should takes the same three arguments as the previous
# handle methods. It is called when a user that is not currently engaged in an activity
# generates a pointerUp event. The user expects a boolean return value. If true is returned
# the user will attempt to attach to and perform this activity. 
  activitySelected:
# The attachUser method is invoked with a single argument, the user that is to be attached.
# If it is valid for the user to begin the activity, it is the attachUser method's responsibility
# to update the user.attachedTo parameter to be set to this activities nodeId. This function should
# handle all appropriate 'a user just joined this activity' functions (such as adjusting the users
# viewpoint to the initial viewpoint location, for example).
  attachUser:
# The detachUser method is invoked with a single argument, the user that is to be detached.
# If it is valid for the user to cease the activity, it is the detachUser method's responsibility
# to update the user.attachedTo parameter to be set to an empty string. This function should
# handle all appropriate 'a user just left this activity' functions (such as adjusting the users
# viewpoint to a 'looking away' viewpoint location, for example).
