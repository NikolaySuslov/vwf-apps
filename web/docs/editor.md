Editor
===================
-------------------
The editor capability of the Virtual World Framework allows for the application to be edited in a live environment. Changes to scripts and properties within the editor are replicated across all clients in the system. 

-------------------

Opening the Editor
-------------------
-------------------
To open the editor interface, move the mouse to the upper ride side of the screen. Upon a mouse rollover, five editor tabs should be displayed. Selecting one will open the editor on the right hand side of the screen, pushing the application view to the left.

The editor consists of five tabs:

* Hierarchy
* Users
* Timeline
* Models
* About

-------------------

Hierarchy
-------------------
-------------------
The Hierarchy tab displays a list of all scripts, behaviors, properties, children, methods, and events in the application. In addition, this tab provides a drill down capability on selected items, allowing complete navigation of the scene structure. Some items can also be edited directly with text based inputs.

**Scripts**

*Creating New Script*

*Editing Script*

**Behaviors**

Behaviors can be attached to any node in the scene. For all nodes with behaviors, upon drilling into the selected node, a list of all implemented behaviors will be displayed. 

**Properties**

**Children**

**Methods**

**Events**

-------------------

Users
-------------------
-------------------
The Users tab shows a list of all user IDs currently in the application instance.

-------------------

Timeline
-------------------
-------------------
The Timeline tab contains a pause and stop button which, when pressed, will pause and stop the application clock, respectively. In this case, the pause button will change to a play button which will allow the clock to be started again. Additionally, the Timeline tab also allows the clock speed to be adjusted to be faster or slower, depending on where the slider is dragged. The rate will be numerically displayed below in relation to the normal time.

-------------------

Models
-------------------
-------------------
The Models tab allows for the creation of new children in the scene. Upon opening the tab, a list of all available models on the server is displayed. Clicking on any of the listed models will drill down into that model, allowing the user to set some initial properties, including the rotation, scale, and translation offset(distance from the drop location). After setting these properties, the user can then drag the *Drag to Create* area and drop it on any location in the scene. Upon the drop, the new object will be created with the specified properties. 

-------------------

About
-------------------
-------------------
The About tab displays the current version of the Virtual World Framework used in the application, where the first number describes a major release, the second a minor release, the third a patch, and finally, the revision number of the build. The tab also contains links to the main webpage and github repository for user reference.
