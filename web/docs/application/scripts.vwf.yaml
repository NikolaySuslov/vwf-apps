# Scripts create the component's internal behavior. The system's `initialize` message and other node
# notifications are delivered here. The component may provide private support functions for property
# accessors and method calls as scripts. The component's events are fired from here. The component
# inherits scripts from its prototype and receives copies of scripts declared in its behaviors.
scripts:
# Most declarations use a short specifier and only provide the body text.

  this.initialize = function() {
    // initialization code
  }
# A long specifier allows external scripts to be loaded.
