# Methods define the component's public functions. The component inherits methods from its prototype
# and receives copies of methods defined in its behaviors. Redefining those methods here will
# override the inherited ones.
methods:
  # Use a short specifier and only provide the body.
  short: |
    // method body
  # The long specifier allows named parameters in the body. The function may still parse the
  # arguments when needed.
  long:
    parameters:
    - one
    - two
    body: |
      var three = arguments[2]
      this.something( one, two, three )
  # A method may be declared empty,
  later:
# ... and initialized in a script.
