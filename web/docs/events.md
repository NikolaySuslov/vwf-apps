# Event System

--------------

 **Coming soon!**

--------------

<!--
•	Mention how same syntax (this.name = function()), does two different things – replace one function w/ a second vs. adding two event handlers 
•	Do objects distribute events to their children (mouseOver) 
•   If I extend a component definition, and both have a handler, which get fired (both) 
•	Two flavors: o	UI events (coming from the outside and system tells a particular node about it – this bubbles up through parents until it is handled) – is called from the node itself (that’s where you attach the event listener) o Node to node communication 
•	Talk about capture phase and bubble phase • Show an event from one node going to a second 
•   This.events.remove(function reference) 
•	This.events.flush()
