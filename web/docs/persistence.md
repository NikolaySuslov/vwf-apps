Persistence
===================
-------------------
Persistence, or the ability to save an application state to load at a later time, is a built-in feature of the editor view of the framework. 

To save the current state of an application instance:

  1. Open the Users tab of the [editor](documentation.html#editor).  
  2. Enter a file name for the file to save (if no name is entered, the instance ID from the URL will be selected).  
  3. Click the Save button. The document will be saved in /documents/app_name/file_name/ within the vwf directory.  

To open a previously saved application:

  1. Open the Users tab of the [editor](documentation.html#editor).  
  2. Select the drop down list above the Load button, and choose a file to load.  
  3. Click the Load button. The application will be loaded in the current browser tab.  

Note: Persistence functionality is only enabled in development mode on the server.
