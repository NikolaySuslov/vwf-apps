About
=====================

Overview
---------------------
The Virtual World Framework (VWF) is a fast, light-weight web-based architecture for creating and distributing secure, scalable, component-based collaborative virtual spaces. It leverages existing web-based standards, infrastructure, and emerging technologies with the intent of establishing a powerful yet simple to use platform that is built on top of the next generation of web browsers. These technologies include HTML 5 – a significant upgrade in expressive power for the web; WebGL – an integrated 3D graphics capability; WebSockets – providing a full TCP/IP connection between the client and server; JavaScript – the programming language of the web; and XMPP – the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (Jabber).  

The VWF will be particularly focused on portable and mobile platforms, as well as scalable, ad-hoc network infrastructure such as cloud computing. It is a zero-install platform, with additional software components added dynamically as required. VWF spaces can be embedded in virtually any application including web pages and emails. Further, VWF spaces can embed existing applications and browsers.


Goals
---------------------
*   Platform scalability - need to work across OSs and devices (desktops - handhelds)
*   Distribution - Needs to be easily deployed across an entire organization with a 0-install preferred. Needs to work on both sides of a firewall.
*   Security - needs to work with existing IT capabilities and requirements
*   Open source - must avoid being a captive solution. Must be accessible to non-business users, especially education
*   Utilize and Define Standards - for interoperability and scalability. Must interoperate and fully enable the Global Information Grid (GIG)
*   Future Proof – must scale dynamically with new requirements and new opportunities while protecting investments in content and infrastructure
*   Business models - must provide interesting business ecosystem for small and large organizations. Must lower the cost of content development while raising the level of quality and affordability.




Replicated computing platform for multi-user interactive 2D and 3D
Focused on training, collaboration and entertainment
Component based model – intelligent objects that can be easily added to existing spaces 
Model view architecture to allow multiple rendering models (2D and 3D) as well as dead-reckoning models
Open Source platform

The next generation of browsers incorporating WebGL coupled with HTML 5 will become the de facto foundation for the next generation of shared virtual worlds. 
The next big 3D platform is simply the current WWW with additional capabilities.
