###WHAT![Virtual World Framework Compass](images/compass.png)

The Virtual World Framework (VWF) is a fast, light-weight, web-based architecture for creating and distributing, scalable, collaborative, and component-based virtual spaces. It leverages existing web-based standards and emerging technologies to establish a powerful yet simple to use platform that is built for the next generation of web browsers.

VWF Applications are built from components, expose their internal state through properties, and synchronize using the reflector server. For more information about what it means to use the framework and become VWF-compatible, visit [compliance](docs/compliance.html).

###WHY![Virtual World Framework](images/framework.png)

The VWF serves as a replicated computing platform for multi-user interactive 2D and 3D components with a high degree of customizability of the environment and high bandwidth communication between users. These are environments that are focused on work and working together – whether for training, collaboration and/or entertainment. 

VWF is a zero-install platform that can be extended dynamically in production. VWF spaces can be embedded anywhere HTML lives including websites and e-mail. Correspondingly, VWF can embed applications in any virtual space.
