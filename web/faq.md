## 3. What are the Virtual World Framework goals? <a name='3' /> 

> * Platform scalability - need to work across OSs and devices (desktops - handhelds)
> * Distribution - Needs to be easily deployed across an entire organization with a 0-install preferred. Needs to work on both sides of a firewall.
> * Security - needs to work with existing IT capabilities and requirements
> * Open source - must avoid being a captive solution. Must be accessible to non-business users, especially education
> * Utilize and Define Standards - for interoperability and scalability. Must interoperate and fully enable the Global Information Grid (GIG)
> * Future Proof – must scale dynamically with new requirements and new opportunities while protecting investments in content and infrastructure
> * Business models - must provide interesting business ecosystem for small and large organizations. Must lower the cost of content development while raising the level of quality and affordability.
