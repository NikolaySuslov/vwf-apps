##General Information


<dl class="accordion" markdown="1">

<dt markdown="1"><a href="">What is Virtual World Framework?</a></dt>
<dd markdown="1">
The Virtual World Framework (VWF) is a browser-based collaborative simulation system designed with the goal of creating content in a shared immersive space. It is a means to connect robust 3D, immersive, entities with other entities (such as objects, avatars, simulations, spaces), content and users via web browsers. It provides the ability for client-server programs to be delivered in a lightweight manner via web browsers and provides synchronization for multiple users to interact with common objects and environments. As an open-source tool protected under the Apache II license, VWF is free and accessible to any number of developers who can create content and expand its scope and functionality. 

For the Modeling & Simulation community, the VWF represents an evolution of the traditional online learning model by allowing the integration of three dimensional environments with other, more typical, content. Traditionally, offering learners an experience in such an environment required the instructional designer to craft content in some external system, often requiring specialty plug-ins and equipment. Many of these systems (i.e. Second Life, or OpenSim) require authors to learn new programming languages and methods that are not typically taught to instructional designers. By leveraging the web as a platform, the VWF makes it possible for a much wider range of authors to create immersive environments. Additionally, the VWF makes deploying this content to the end user much simpler than traditional immersive training packages. While other simulation environments require desktop software installation or browser plugins, the VWF uses cutting edge HTML5 capabilities to deliver its content to a variety of devices like desktops, tablets, and even phones, without any effort by the end user. Users simply type in a URL as they would for any website, and they can access the environment seamlessly.

</dd>

<dt markdown="1"><a href="">How do I get started on using VWF?</a></dt>
<dd markdown="1">
Please visit the <a href="../docs/reqs.html">documentation</a> link and read the Getting Started and Tutorial pages for more information.  
</dd>

<dt markdown="1"><a href="">What are the myths of VWF?</a></dt>
<dd markdown="1">
Even though it has a suggestive name, the VWF is not a virtual world. Nor is it a virtual world generation tool. Can the VWF produce a virtual space and content to fill it? Yes, it can, and it absolutely can be used to provide additional objects and interactions to augment and interact with entities to which it connects. VWF isn’t a simulator. VWF is meant to extend the use of active client-server simulations enabling them to be accessed via a web browser. It is also meant to add extra dimensions to existing simulations or to create simulation content to add to an existing virtual space (such as MOSES) or a spontaneously generated space. VWF has the capability to create fully-functional simulations but is not meant to be a complete simulator on its own. 

VWF is not an avatar, nor does it require an avatar to run. It does not necessarily generate avatars for use with virtual worlds, but can be used to produce or interact with avatars. VWF does not require a virtual space in order to work; it can be used to generate a virtual space within the web browser or locally on the host machine. 
</dd>

<dt markdown="1"><a href="">Why is VWF being created?</a></dt>
<dd markdown="1">
The Department of Defense (DoD) cannot continue to do business as usual. In FY05, the DoD spent $9.1B in Modeling and Simulation related activities. Approximately 40% of that budget was used for simulators, war gaming, and modeling. The vision of the VWF is to reduce the funding currently used to support M&S activities in direct support of pressure to reduce spending and increase efficacy of existing and emerging technology. 

The DoD needs a tool to tie together its myriad, stove-piped, specialty simulations solutions. It needs a tool to extend and expand its ability to train an increasing number of personnel across ever-widening distances. The DoD stresses a need to reduce and reuse technology and to find more cost-efficient means to provide the most advanced technological and pedagogical systems of training. It’s not just about training DoD personnel however. 

We are surrounded by immersive, personalized social media and technology (such as Smart Phones, Facebook, Twitter, Pandora, Project Glass and augmented reality sites such as [Layar](http://www.layar.com). Traditional education systems do not allow for the pace of information sharing and immersion that media, games and the internet provide to youth on a regular basis. In today's world, modernization and customization of education is becoming essential to its effectiveness. The intersection of technologies and the speed and volume of data delivery create a perfect storm of possibility for this system to provide the highest quality at the best cost. 
</dd>

<dt markdown="1"><a href="">What is VWF for?</a></dt>
<dd markdown="1">
VWF is for developers of simulations, education systems, training content, games, information sharing, private individuals, and really anyone with an interest in sharing information with multiple users in a lightweight fashion using a web browser as a delivery mechanism.

VWF allows for users to be able to access information, training, or content no matter where they are or what their hardware or bandwidth restrictions may be, as long as they have a secure link to the training server through the internet. VWF is able to provide rapidly-available content to those who need it most, when they need it, in a fashion which is accessible and low-overhead. 
</dd>

<dt markdown="1"><a href="">What does VWF mean to Business and Government?</a></dt>
<dd markdown="1">
VWF means a massive savings in preventing redundancy, in linking different systems, and in building economies of scale and scope. It means access to unprecedented complexity of training content and a huge flexibility in its delivery. It means faster and more thoroughly trained personnel. It means platform-independent computing solutions for passing any type of data quickly and efficiently. It means highly adaptive, rapid prototypes independent of the platforms which created them. It means staying at the forefront of the computing trends in information sharing. It means a rapid means of generating customized training solutions. It means spontaneous meeting spaces and a method for delivering increased complexity and speed of intelligence to those who need it.

## Licensing and Ownership

<dl class="accordion" markdown="1">

<dt markdown="1"><a href="">Who owns the Virtual World Framework?</a></dt>
<dd markdown="1">
Currently the DoD owns the rights to the source code of the VWF, however as it is licensed using Apache II this means that it is freely usable by any and all as long as original attribution is given to the creators.
</dd>
<dt markdown="1"><a href="">How is the Virtual World Framework licensed?</a></dt>
<dd markdown="1">
The Virtual World Framework is currently licensed under the Apache II license. Essentially it states that the user of the software is granted a royalty-free license to use, modify, sell derivative works of the software as long as the original license and attribution file(s) are included in the distribution of any and all subsequent works. The original work is licensed “as is” and contains no warranties of any kind.
</dd>
<!-- <dt markdown="1"><a href="">Who is designing the Virtual World Framework?</a></dt>
<dd markdown="1">
TBD
</dd> -->
<dt markdown="1"><a href="">How are content rights managed?</a></dt>
<dd markdown="1">
Presently content rights are managed via the provisions contained in the Apache 2 license. The current content version control is affected by the primary engineers through github, with the latest stable builds published under unique serial numbers.
</dd>
<dt markdown="1"><a href="">Who can contribute to the Virtual World Framework?</a></dt>
<dd markdown="1">
VWF is currently posted on [github](https://github.com/virtual-world-framework), and is open to any and all developers who wish to contribute forks, projects, suggestions or build-outs for the framework. The original creators especially seek major platform developers who wish to add interfacing to their platform for use with VWF, such as MMOs, simulations designers, terrain mapping providers, 3D modeling, virtual landscapes, etc.
</dd>
</dl>


----------------

## Development Path


<dl class="accordion" markdown="1">

<dt markdown="1"><a href="">How will the Virtual World Framework evolve and how will it be managed?</a></dt>
<dd markdown="1">
The VWF is currently managed via github and developer inputs through a loose consortium of the original creators. In time, the community will stand up a non-profit governing organization, in order to conduct full-time partnerships and version control of the software. Through the use of the latest technology and partnerships with major content, object and texture providers, VWF will potentially evolve into the standard for interfacing content with users on the web.
</dd>
<dt markdown="1"><a href="">When will the Virtual World Framework be available for use in web applications?</a></dt>
<dd markdown="1">
VWF is currently available for use in web applications, and there are a few minor application and demonstration proofs of concept that can be found in the [public directory](https://www.github.com/virtual-world-framework). As the community extends the robustness of the VWF, increases the libraries and finalizes the toolkits, these applications will gain in complexity as well. Currently developers are welcome to construct web applications with the existing code and examples. There is nothing special required to run completed applications outside of having access to a compatible browser with Web Sockets and WebGL for 3D content.
</dd>
<dt markdown="1"><a href="">Why create a new framework when so many of them already exist?</a></dt>
<dd markdown="1">
Currently there are no development tools in widespread use that interface different entities in a persistent, secure manner using a thin client through web-browsers. There are other tools which produce virtual environments, avatars, and content, but none that tie them together, spontaneously create interfaces among them or provide seamless communications to all of the entities regardless of their timing. VWF does this and will do more as it continues its evolution. Furthermore, the VWF utilizes Web Sockets and WebGL, directly providing a content link between entities in a quick, efficient manner.
</dd>
<dt markdown="1"><a href="">Where can I get more information about the Virtual World Framework?</a></dt>
<dd markdown="1">
Currently VWF information is available on two sites: [http://www.virtualworldframework.com](http://www.virtualworldframework.com) and [www.github.com/virtual-world-framework/vwf](http://www.github.com/virtual-world-framework/vwf). There is also a wikipedia entry on virtual world framework accessible via [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_world_framework](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_world_framework).

## VWF Applications

<dl class="accordion" markdown="1">

<dt markdown="1"><a href="">For what training tasks can I expect the VWF to be useful and by when?</a></dt>
<dd markdown="1">
The framework can be applied to training content for most DoD tasks which do not require solely live training, specifically: training facilitated through simulations, classroom training, augmented reality, mixed media training, and games. Furthermore, for example, a VWF developer can take video lesson plans, objects, and avatars, and successfully insert them into an existing virtual or created landscape (such as EDGE or Open Sim), interacting with the native objects and users via the VWF interface. Additionally, simulations which combine live training with simulated content are good candidates for the VWF.

VWF further opens the door to interface different training content, simulations, objects, users and locations, which will extend and expand the scope of training and education (imagine running a tank simulation with aviation assets, provided by two different simulations suites but executed together and passing imagery and sensor data between them, working over a common landscape and feeding a constructive mapping simulation run on a third platform, all seamlessly and transparent to the users). The VWF has been proven to work with MMOs such as EDGE, and ideally will be developed to interface with the latest object encodings (such as Unity and MP4), environments (such as OpenSim/MOSES) and simulations platforms in order to create a truly agnostic interfacing tool.

The complexity of the training and the number of trainees largely dictates the date by which this VWF capability will be delivered. The current version of the framework is currently capable of delivery of both classroom and simulations-type, and natively provides the synchronization elements needed for such an application. For augmented reality and truly immersive gaming, VWF will continue to be developed with critical partners and hopes to have this capability in the coming 24 months, depending on current technologies and partnerships.
</dd>
<dt markdown="1"><a href="">Will the VWF be used in LVC exercises?</a></dt>
<dd markdown="1">
Ideally, VWF will be used in live, virtual, and constructive (LVC) exercises as a primary or secondary delivery mechanism. LVC is ideal for VWF delivery due to its large virtual / digital component and its need to be delivered to myriad audiences in a variety of locations and platforms.
</dd>
<dt markdown="1"><a href="">How will live training interact with the VWF?</a></dt>
<dd markdown="1">
Through sensor data (read off of the radar/weapons/sensors on the live equipment directly into the simulation), data streaming through interfacing servers (in the case of personnel/equipment trackers such as BFT) and through information injection through constructive simulations (such as placing live units on a map and manually tracking their status/positions).
</dd>
<dt markdown="1"><a href="">How will constructive sims take place in the VWF?</a></dt>
<dd markdown="1">
Simulations do not take place “in” the Virtual World Framework. VWF is a tool to help interface different entities. Constructive simulations, in which simulated people operate simulated systems, are stimulated using human inputs. Ostensibly the VWF would provide the interface (via the web) for some or all of these humans who would be inputting data into the system, then would receive the simulation results from the program executing on the server machine/cloud/locally-determined-host, and would display the results in some fashion via web interface.
</dd>
<dt markdown="1"><a href="">What skills are required to build simulations in the VWF?</a></dt>
<dd markdown="1">
Presently developers use the VWF to build simulations using JavaScript and functionality provided through the VWF. The framework generates the appropriate display and manipulation files at the time of compilation. As the VWF develops, a construction environment will be developed in order to allow users to drag and drop content and manipulate it, greatly reducing production time/complexity. This sample environment is currently available on the [Demos](catalog.html) page.

## Security Considerations

<dl class="accordion" markdown="1">

<dt markdown="1"><a href="">Is the web secure enough for a virtual world framework?</a></dt>
<dd markdown="1">
The web is agnostic to content. VWF is not secure or unsecure. The use of secure socket layer encryption, virtual private networks, public-key-encryption, proprietary encryption, hardware secured network systems, etc. provides the security needed to secure any simulations produced and interfaced using the VWF. With the use of IPv6, bit-wise security protocols are available that were previously not available to data transport. A security bit header may be added to the data transported via VWF in order to provide an additional layer of security. 
</dd>
<dt markdown="1"><a href="">Are there problems with WebSockets and do they have solutions?</a></dt>
<dd markdown="1">
The problem with opening a continuous connection between two computers via a web browser using Web Sockets is that it potentially opens up the link to something called cache poisoning, in which someone can directly introduce viruses or other malware to the link, compromising the system. [Here](http://blog.kotowicz.net/2011/03/html5-websockets-security-new-tool-for.html) is a summary of other weaknesses. Originally, potential security issues led Mozilla and Opera to discontinue support for Web Sockets until the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) could produce a standardized Web Sockets protocol as part of HTML5. A work around based on [Connect based handshakes](http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/hybi/current/msg04744.html) (as opposed to upgrade- based handshakes) proved to be secure. The semantics of the handshake as coded into VWF will take this into account. Since late 2011 this has been largely addressed with latest builds and standards, and many web platforms do currently support Web Sockets.

## WebGL

<dl class="accordion" markdown="1">

<dt markdown="1"><a href="">What is WebGL?</a></dt>
<dd markdown="1">
WebGL (web graphics library) is a JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D graphics within any compatible web browser without using plug-ins. WebGL programs include control code (written in JavaScript) and shader code which is executed on the graphics processing unit on the video card (GPU). WebGL is designed and maintained by the non-profit Khronos Group. (Excerpt from Wikipedia).
</dd>
<dt markdown="1"><a href="">What browsers will be supporting WebGL and when will they be available?</a></dt>
<dd markdown="1">
Mozilla Firefox 4.0 onward, Opera 11 onward, Google Chrome 9 onward (native support), Safari 5.1 onward. So far, Internet Explorer does not support WebGL and has not announced any plans to support WebGL. Chrome Frame and IEWebGL plug-ins support WebGL for IE 6.0 onward.

Safari, Opera, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox are all currently available and all support WebGL in their current versions.
</dd>
<dt markdown="1"><a href="">Who will control the WebGL standard?</a></dt>
<dd markdown="1">
The WebGL standard is currently affected by the Khronos Group, Mozilla, Apple, and Google, along with influence from United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team which raises security concerns to which the WebGL consortium (headed by the Khronos Group) react.
</dd>
<!-- <dt markdown="1"><a href="">Is WebGL fast enough to support the VWF?</a></dt>
<dd markdown="1">
TBD
</dd> -->
<dt markdown="1"><a href="">What devices will support WebGL capable browsers?</a></dt>
<dd markdown="1">
Currently all PCs, laptops, and tablets support WebGL capable browsers. Mobile support for WebGL is currently nascent. Expectations are that current mobile bindings for JavaScript and WebGL are not good enough but there is an Android version of Firefox with WebGL (only about 10% of potential users access content via mobile device requiring WebGL support). Opera also supports WebGL on Android platforms. iPhone does not support WebGL as of yet.
</dd>
</dl>


----------------

## Javascript

<dl class="accordion" markdown="1">

<dt markdown="1"><a href="">What is JavaScript?</a></dt>
<dd markdown="1">
JavaScript is a prototype-based scripting language that is dynamic, weakly typed, general purpose and supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles. This means that JavaScript enables the programmer to build a series of prototypes and interact with them using a mostly-literal syntax based on C. Due to its ease of use and widespread appeal, JavaScript has quickly became the most popular programming language for web applications. 
</dd>
<!-- <dt markdown="1"><a href="">Is JavaScript fast enough and flexible enough for creating real virtual worlds?</a></dt>
<dd markdown="1">
TBD
</dd> -->
<dt markdown="1"><a href="">Why don't you use Java or C#?</a></dt>
<dd markdown="1">
JavaScript runs locally in the browsers, does not require additional plug ins or environments (like the Java runtime environment) to run, and does not require compilation or .exe files to be run on the client machine in order to work. It is faster, more efficient, and simpler to build and execute than either Java or C#.
</dd>
</dl>


----------------

## Standards

<dl class="accordion" markdown="1">

<dt markdown="1"><a href="">What standards does the Virtual World Framework plan to support?</a></dt>
<dd markdown="1">
HTML 5.0, ECMAScript5, WebGL, Web Sockets, Collada (or other later model file formats)
</dd>
</dl>


----------------

## Community and Governance

<dl class="accordion" markdown="1">

<dt markdown="1"><a href="">Is there a process in place for developers to contribute code and ideas to VWF?</a></dt>
<dd markdown="1">
Yes. Developers can download the latest build of VWF from github and submit their recommendations, code and applications directly on the site. Github allows user to create their own forks, submit pull requests, and leave questions, comments, and support related items in the issue tracker.
</dd>
<dt markdown="1"><a href="">Will the VWF be available to coalition partners?</a></dt>
<dd markdown="1">
VWF is currently available freely and openly on github to any and all persons, regardless of origin. VWF content specifically designed for operations will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis depending on the content, training objectives, and coalition goals being exercised. There is no standing reason why VWF cannot be shared and there are no security restrictions on the original code. As an open source program, there are currently no restrictions to anyone downloading the original source code on [github](https://www.github.com/virtual-world-framework).
</dd>
</dl>


----------------

## Business Models

<dl class="accordion" markdown="1">

<dt markdown="1"><a href="">Can commercial entities build servies or games with VWF?</a></dt>
<dd markdown="1">
Absolutely. VWF is meant to interface content via the web, but it also contains construction pieces enabling the creation of games or communications services wholly executable within the web browser. These games and services would capitalize on the direct link between entities facilitated by the VWF, while the company would determine where the resources were located. For example: A game company might use VWF to create an online game using their proprietary graphics, and store both the graphics and the program files on their own servers while delivering that content through the web; a teleconference company might more efficiently create an e-classroom with the VWF to take their own streaming media codec and pass their video through the web to a digital classroom environment created wholly with the VWF, complete with avatars and interactive objects.
