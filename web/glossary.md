Glossary
=====================

Accessor
------------
A script that monitors, modifies, or intercepts property get or set operations.

Action
------------
State change executed by the kernel.

Application
------------
A component loaded as the top definition of a VWF instance.

Behavior
------------
A fractional component that adds functionality to a component.

Bubbling
------------
Flowing an object up to the previous method calls until it either reaches the top or it reaches a method that is implemented to handle it.

Capturing
------------
Means of gathering specific data

Catalog
------------
A listing of applications and components.

Child
------------
A node that is spawned by an existing node that is hierarchically higher.

Client
------------
Connection to the reflector.du

Component
------------
A piece of a VWF application, serving as a prototype, behavior, child, or the application itself. Components are stored collections of configured nodes.

Dispatched Event
------------
Event that captures down and bubbles up all the path from the application root to the target node.

Driver
------------
Module that extends the kernel.

Event
------------
Outgoing function call.

Event Data
------------
Data delivered to all nodes for a dispatched event.

Event Node Data
------------
Data delivered per node for a dispatched event.

Future
------------
Method call that will be triggered in a certain amount of time specified by the parameter

Kernel
------------
Machinery that creates the application environment.

ID
------------
Unique identifier that is used to represent objects

Member
------------
Property, method, event, or child of a node that an action is executed on.

Method
------------
Incoming function call.

Model
------------
Driver that executes within the shared state.

Module
------------
The kernel (future), drivers, and supporting libraries (future) are JavaScript modules in loaded on demand. Modules are in the RequireJS format.

Node
------------
The atomic unit of a VWF application. Nodes maintain state in properties, provide methods for incoming function calls, provide events for outgoing function calls, reference child nodes, and contain scripts to glue the pieces together.

Parent
------------
A node that has knowledge of exactly one hierarchically higher node and multiple child nodes.

Property
------------
Node state

Prototype
------------
A component that provides base functionality for a component.

Reflector
------------
Server managing an instance, synchronizing state, and ticking time.

Scripts
------------
A collection of property and function definitions.

Time
------------
Quantized forward progression generated by the reflector.

View
------------
Driver that executes outside of the shared state.
