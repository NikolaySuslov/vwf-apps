[A]:"A"
---------------------
## A

> ### Accessor

> A script that monitors, modifies, or intercepts property get or set operations.

> ### Action

> State change executed by the kernel.

> ### Application

> A component loaded as the top definition of a VWF instance.

[B]:"B"
---------------------
## B

> ### Behavior

> A fractional component that adds functionality to a component.

> ### Bubbling

> Flowing an object up to the previous method calls until it either reaches the top or it reaches a method that is implemented to handle it.

[C]:"C"
---------------------
## C

> ### Capturing

> Means of gathering specific data

> ### Catalog

> A listing of applications and components.

> ### Child

> A node that is spawned by an existing node that is hierarchically higher.

> ### Client

> Connection to the reflector.du

> ### Component

> A piece of a VWF application, serving as a prototype, behavior, child, or the application itself. Components are stored collections of configured nodes.

[D]:"D"
---------------------
## D

> ### Dispatched Event

> Event that captures down and bubbles up all the path from the application root to the target node.

> ### Driver

> Module that extends the kernel.

[E]:"E"
---------------------
## E

> ### Event

> Outgoing function call.

> ### Event Data

> Data delivered to all nodes for a dispatched event.

> ### Event Node Data

> Data delivered per node for a dispatched event.

[F]:"F"
---------------------
## F

> ### Future

> Method call that will be triggered in a certain amount of time specified by the parameter

[I]:"I"
---------------------
## I

> ### ID

> Unique identifier that is used to represent objects

[K]:"K"
---------------------
## K

> ### Kernel

> Machinery that creates the application environment.

[M]:"M"
---------------------
## M

> ### Member

> Property, method, event, or child of a node that an action is executed on.

> ### Method

> Incoming function call.

> ### Model

> Driver that executes within the shared state.

> ### Module

> The kernel (future), drivers, and supporting libraries (future) are JavaScript modules in loaded on demand. Modules are in the RequireJS format.

[N]:"N"
---------------------
## N

> ### Node

> The atomic unit of a VWF application. Nodes maintain state in properties, provide methods for incoming function calls, provide events for outgoing function calls, reference child nodes, and contain scripts to glue the pieces together.

[P]:"P"
---------------------
## P

> ### Parent

> A node that has knowledge of exactly one hierarchically higher node and multiple child nodes.

> ### Property

> Node state

> ### Prototype

> A component that provides base functionality for a component.

[R]:"R"
---------------------
## R

> ### Reflector

> Server managing an instance, synchronizing state, and ticking time.

[S]:"S"
---------------------
## S

> ### Scripts

> A collection of property and function definitions.

[T]:"T"
---------------------
## T

> ### Time

> Quantized forward progression generated by the reflector.

[V]:"V"
---------------------
## V

> ### View

> Driver that executes outside of the shared state.
