## B <a name='B' />

> ### Behavior

> A fractional component that adds functionality to a component.

> ### Bubbling

[N]:#N
---------------------
## N <a name='N' />

> ### Node

> The atomic unit of a VWF application. Nodes maintain state in properties, provide methods for incoming function calls, provide events for outgoing function calls, reference child nodes, and contain scripts to glue the pieces together.
